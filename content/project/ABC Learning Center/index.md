<h1>ABC Learning Center</h1>

<p>ABC Learning Center is an IT training institute where learners grasp the fundamentals of programming languages. They want to move forward and expand their network globally and want all interested students to get a chance to learn from their institute.</p>

<p>Since ABC Learning center was never introduced to digitalization all their work was done manually which led to many difficulties such as, the registration of leads would be done manually on paper and sometimes the paper were misplaced, sometimes the written handwriting was too difficult to understand which caused in losing the potential customers. Doing work manually took a lot of time which directly caused a decrement in productivity</p>

<p>The complete web development and design process was divided into various smaller and short processes which includes planning content strategy, pre and post build testing, optimization, launch etc.
Both Site owners and site users point of view were kept in mind and implemented.
Took the 1st step while keeping the web designer's mantra in mind.</p>
<h3>"I'm here to provide the best possible informational user experience to the end users, regardless of how they choose to access the information."</h3>
<br>
<p>Created an information architecture as a starting point. This made it easier to understand how the website's links connected and how information flowed across them.</p>
<p>The designing of wireframes and prototypes came next. Each web page's wireframe was designed to give a smooth user experience. When designing prototypes, the aim was to create an easy-to-use User interface.
 </p>
 <p>With help of a story board, the whole functionality of the website was visualized. This made it easier to comprehend the navigation flow in chronological order. </p>

<p>With the clear prototypes, I started with devloping the front-end using html, css and javascript. After 50 cups of coffee, many sleepless nights and 80+ hours of coding I finally developed the front-end. Next up started with unit testing followed by integration testing.  </p>

<p>With all that the ABC Learning Center website was ready for deployment. I finally did the deployment using github and it was all glitters and sparkles vibeâœ¨âœ¨ðŸš€
